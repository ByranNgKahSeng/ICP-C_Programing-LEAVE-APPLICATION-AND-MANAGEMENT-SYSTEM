# ICP-C_Programing-LEAVE-APPLICATION-AND-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
System for leave application and management using C Programming
APU is a well-known private university located in Bukit Jalil, Kuala Lumpur. Currently, the university has more than 500 staffs and they are attached to different departments and schools. In general, staffs can be classified into four (4) main categories, i.e.  academic, administration, management, and technical. Recently, the university has decided to develop a new system for better efficiency in leave application and management. You as a programmer in the university has been appointed to be fully in-charged for the development of the system. Basically, the system has three types of users, and they are admin staff (leave management), staff (leave application), and superior (leave approval). Once the system is launched, staffs are required to login with valid username and password to enter the main screen before they can execute any task. 
The system will identify admin users automatically once they login successfully. For staff users, their roles can be leave applicant or approver (if he/she is an immediate supervisor of other staffs). The followings outlined the main functions/tasks that could be performed by users in the system.
a.	Admin
•	add new staff’s information (including his leave details) to the system
•	update the leave balance (annual leave, compassionate leave, emergency leave, maternity leave, medical leave, etc.) of staff for every new year or when it is necessary
•	search for any staff’s leave information using staff ID or name
•	generate monthly report (text file) for the leave statistics of each department or school 
b.	Staff
•	Apply leave
•	Cancel leave (approved or pending status, cannot cancel if the on-leave date has passed)
•	Check the leave status
•	Check the summary of leave information
c.	Leave Approver
•	Approve or reject leave application(s)
•	Can search a date and view the number of staff who applied leave on the specified date (this could provide more information on the approval of leave)
The submitted system should be compiled and executed without errors. Besides, validation should be done wherever needed. Staff leave balances and leave records need to be stored in text files. Primary Key should be implemented, no duplication of same staff or leave records should be accepted.
